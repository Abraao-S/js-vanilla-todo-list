# A really simple pseudo to-do list to practice vanilla JS concepts

Although the project is really simple it forced me to read a lot about the Web API's documentation and to understand a little bit about how each interface works and how they communicate.

### The ones I read about and used:
- Document interface
- Storage interface
- Event interface
